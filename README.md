# ASE Cases
Gene-level Allele Specific Expression Data from Case Cohorts. Briefly for each cohort documented, gene-level haplotype aggregated ASE data has been provided following the best practice protocols. 

### Datasets
## MDM
_MDM_case_ase.csv_: 46 Muscular Dystrophy Samples from the Genetics of [Inherited Muscle Disease Cohort (dbGAP)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000655.v3.p1). Phasing of genotypes was performed using EAGLE and the Illumina 30x high coverage genotypes. ASE data was generated using the [PAC](https://github.com/anna-saukkonen/PAC) pipeline.
